        <h1>Travel to ....</h1>
        <h2 class="location"> Niagra Falls! </h2>
        <img src="https://www.kasandbox.org/programming-images/landscapes/waterfall_niagara-falls.png" alt = "Niagra Falls Waterfall" width="300">
        <p><strong class="location">Niagra Falls</strong> would be a <em id="beauty">beautiful</em> place to travel to!</p>
        <p>Some of the few things I would like to do include:<br>
            <ul><li>Visit the waterfall.</li>
            <li>Eat good food!</li>
            <li>Tour the surrounding town.</li>
            
            </ul><br>
            </p>
            
            <p class="travel-guests"> I would love to go here with friends and family. That would be so much more fun!<br> But who would I bring with me?<ol>
                <li>Ani</li>
                <li>Mom</li>
                <li>Su</li>
            </ol>
           <p > I think that would be a great group to bring with me. My friends and I could go out shopping and then I could go on a morning brunch with my mom! Then we all could go see the waterfall later in the day!</p>
           <p class="food"> We could go out to <em><strong>eat</strong></em> ice cream too!</p>
           <img src="https://www.kasandbox.org/programming-images/food/ice-cream.png" alt = "Ice Cream" width="200">
           <p class="food">Or something a bit savory, like...fish?</p>
           <img src="https://www.kasandbox.org/programming-images/food/fish_grilled-snapper.png" alt= "Fish Dinner Plate" width="200">
           <p class="food">Or maybe just sushi! :3</p>
